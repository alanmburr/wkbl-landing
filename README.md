# wkbl-landing
A unorganized attempt to organize [wkbl.cf](https://wkbl.cf?h).<br>
![Wkbl.cf landing page](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wackyblackie/wkbl-landing/landing.png)
***
## wkbl.cf and www.wkbl.cf
Wkbl.cf is my short domain that I use for a multitude of little PHP and HTML projects. WWW redirects to non-WWW.<br>
The main domain is hosted at [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net) where I test my PHP projects.
**Note:** Append `?h` to wkbl.cf to see the Breadcrumbs. [wkbl.cf?h](https://wkbl.cf/?h)

## s.wkbl.cf
S.wkbl.cf is the subdomain I use for my short [Cutt.ly](https://www.cutt.ly) links.<br>
Cutt.ly is a free link shortener. This is the first subdomain created.

## g.wkbl.cf
G.wkbl.cf is the subdomain I use for my short [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) links.<br>
Dynamic Links are a feature of Firebase by Google. This is the second subdomain created.

## ww1.wkbl.cf
WW1.wkbl.cf is the "parking" page I made for wkbl.cf. Bare wkbl.cf redirects here.<br>
If I had a do-over, I would choose main.wkbl.cf instead. But hey, YOLO ðŸ˜‚!<br>
This subdomain is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) along with [www.wackyblackie.gq](https://www.wackyblackie.gq).
